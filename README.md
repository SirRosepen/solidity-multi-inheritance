# Multiple Inheritance in Solidity

This repository contains 4 Contracts A, B1, B2, C that share code through inheritance.
It isolates an edge case that is not very intuitive to understand from just
looking at the code.

To understand what is happening, the best way is to run the Hardhat tests and see why one of them fails.
